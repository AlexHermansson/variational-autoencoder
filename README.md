# Variational Autoencoder

An implementation of VAE using TensorFlow 2.0, check out the code in the [notebook](https://github.com/AlexHermansson/variational-autoencoder/blob/master/VAE.ipynb).
The trained model hallucinates some nice looking MNIST digits!

If you want to try it out: clone the repo, install the requirements in the `requirements.txt` by running (for example in a virtual env) `$pip install -r requirements.txt` if you're using pip, and then play around with the notebook!
